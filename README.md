# NextJS
At this example i will review NextJS core concepts using Rocketseat bonus course as reference.

## How to`s 

1 - First clone this repo using `git clone` command inside your terminal <br>
2 - Run `yarn` command inside your terminal, to install all project dependencies using the same package manager that i use (you can use `npm install` if prefer...)<br>
4 - Run `yarn dev` to initialize this application at http://localhost:3000<br>

Enjoy!
